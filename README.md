# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 9 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Vulnerability #2: SQL Injection (SQLi)

GIF walkthrough: <img src="https://github.com/CTUDEV/Web-Security-Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/SQLI%20Blue.gif" width="800">

We can see that the page is loading longer on the blue website than it does on the other websites when we do SQLI.


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration

The message for existing username is written in bold, but when we enter a non-existent username it is not written in bold. 

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

GIF walkthrough: <img src="https://github.com/CTUDEV/Web-Security-Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/IDOR%20Red.gif" width="800">

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

We can create a form using HTML that will be submitted through the Feedback page to prompt admin to follow the link. Once the link is followed the information on a chosen page, for example, Find a Salesperson will be changed because the form will have an HTML attribute 'onload' which will submit it instantly. We can use HTML attributes 'style' and 'target' to hide the form and its results. 

## Optional


Bonus Objective 2:Â Build on Objective #4 (Cross-Site Scripting). Experiment to see if you can use XSS to: a) direct the user to a new URL.
